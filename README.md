Yee guys, yes, this is MY webiste I created with my dad almost a year ago on March 18th, 2018 i think (its feels like 2 seconds since this year was kinda hard lol) when my dad and my brother and I were each making our websites it was really really hard! It was really stressful and annoying because nothing fucking worked out and the tutorial was pretty bad imo. Now, on April 16, 2019 I am trying to improve my website and make it not only look way cooler but I am also trying to add new things on here too so its more than just an about page. I am working on this BY MYSELF now since our dad was satisfied with how our progress went i guess. My discord is Makoto Naguy#5433 if u want more information, but thats all i have to say rn. Its literally 2 am on april "break" in the same place I worked on this website a year ago (coinsidence??) and yeah i thought i should add this readme here. I really dont like the stupid normie shill cuck SAT test... SIIIIIIIIIGHHHHHHHH
