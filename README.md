Ay guys, yes, this is MY webiste I created with my dad almost a year ago on March 18th, 2018 i think (It feels like 2 seconds since 2018) when we were each making our websites, it was really stressful and annoying because nothing fucking worked out and the tutorial was pretty bad imo. Now, on April 16, 2019 I am trying to improve my website and make it not only look way cooler, but I am also trying to add new things on here too so its more than just an about page. I am working on this BY MYSELF now since our dad was satisfied with how our progress went i guess. If u want more information, but thats all i have to say rn. Its literally 2 am on 2019 april "break" in the same place I worked on this website a year ago (coinsidence??) and yeah i thought i should add this readme here. I really dont like the stupid normie shill cuck SAT test... SIIIIIIIIIGHHHHHHHH

I will be making this site more improved and I will try to make it as good as possible! It has looked kinda crappy but it will get better soon hopefully.
