Ay guys, yes, this is MY website I created with my dad almost a year ago on March 18th, 2018 i think (It feels like 2 seconds since 2018) when we were each making our websites, it was a bit challenging at first, but now, on April 16 2019 I am trying to improve my website and make it not only look way cooler, but I am also trying to add new things so its more than just an about page. I am working on this by myself now since our dad was satisfied with how our progress went. Its 2 am on 2019 april "break" in the same place I worked on this website a year ago (coinsidence??) and yeah i thought i should add this readme here.

I will be making improvements to this site more and I will try to make it as good as possible!
